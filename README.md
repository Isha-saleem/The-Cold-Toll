## The Game of Survival

You are the leader of a small village plunged into an eternal winter. Your goal is simple: survive as many days as possible. Every day, you face a new random event that requires you to make a difficult, often moral, choice.

=> Survival depends on managing three critical resources, all starting at 100:

=> Food (per person): Needed to keep the village from starving. It drains daily.

=> Wood (Fuel): Essential for warmth and fire against the cold. It also drains daily.

=> Hope (Morale): Represents the community's will to live. If hope runs out, people give up.

Each decision you make—like sacrificing medicine for food, or burning a toolshed instead of a library—will drastically impact these resources and the game's atmosphere. If any single resource drops to zero, the game ends, and you see how many days you managed to keep the village alive.
